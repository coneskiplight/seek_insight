## Why Services Trade?

As technology evolves, trade is no longer limited to tangible goods. Apart from new economy companies and services providers, more industries are offering and procuring services and intangible solutions, including app development, advertising spaces and more. That’s why we have extended our trade solutions to services consumed or sold during different stages of a trade cycle With our services trade financing solution, you can get financed through trade financing solution instead of conventional overdraft to services related operating activities.

While your business evolves with time, our solutions can have you covered.
