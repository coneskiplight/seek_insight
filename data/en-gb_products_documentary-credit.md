## What is a Documentary Credit ?

A Documentary Credit (DC) is an undertaking by a buyer’s bank to pay its suppliers for goods or services, subject to agreed conditions.

DCs are used extensively in financing of international trade because they offer assurance that both the parties will fulfil their obligations in the trade.

## Key benefits

Compared to traditional methods, such as cash payments or wire transfers, DCs provide increased protection against the risks associated with cross-border transactions. They also ensure timely payment and **facilitate easier access to working capital finance**.

**For buyers**, Import DCs can help you secure your international purchases and give you the ability to negotiate better contract terms, such as increasing supplier’s credit period.

### When you apply for an DC

* you show your supplier you have the ability to pay for the goods
* you are asking HSBC to provide payment security to your suppliers
* you can tailor your expectations in the terms of shipping, delivery, insurance and quality inspection from your suppliers in the DC

**For suppliers**, Export DCs minimise export payment risk and provide easier access to financing without the need for a credit facility.

### When you receive an DC

* you are getting a commitment from the buyer’s bank to pay you if your documents comply with the DC conditions
* you can generally request for an advance of funds against compliant documents
* you can mitigate your risk on the buyer’s bank by asking HSBC to add our confirmation to your DC
