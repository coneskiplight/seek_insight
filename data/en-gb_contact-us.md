Smart Tip: At busy times, Business customers can seek faster assistance by using the chat services on our website, through Business Internet Banking or through the HSBC HK Business Express mobile app. This applies particularly during our peak hours (Monday – Friday, 10am – 4pm), when waiting times for our customer service hotline are likely to be longer.

With effect from 16 February 2025, HSBC Business Phone Banking will not support enquiry of inward remittance status. You can log on to HSBC HK Business Express Mobile app or Business Internet Banking. Check the latest update under [ Payment Tracker ]. Please visit [Important Notices](/en-gb/regulations/important-notices) for our latest service information.
