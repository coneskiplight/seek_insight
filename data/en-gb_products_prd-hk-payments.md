## Illustrative example

A large Hong Kong based importer of consumer electronic products has their top trading partners based in Guangzhou.

The supplier delivers the goods once they confirm payments have been credited in their accounts. Any delay in the confirmed receipt of funds impacts the delivery of goods and subsequently the business between the two partners. Additionally, efficiency of the importer is reduced, as they must commit more time to track the payments.

Taking advantage of the PRD/HK Payment solution from HSBC, the Hong Kong importer can complete the payments on priority basis and receive goods provided by their trading partner faster. By using this service, the company not only enjoys the preferential banking services from HSBC; they will also strengthen their relationships with their trading partners, positioning the company for future growth.
