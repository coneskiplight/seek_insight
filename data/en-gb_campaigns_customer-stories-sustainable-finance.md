How do Hong Kong businesses achieve success by partnering with a bank that shares a philosophy for sustainability?

Hong Kong is positioning itself as the region's leading green financing hub. Many of its industries have already embraced the ‘green transformation', a model to drive business value while at the same time, contributing to the environment. A sustainable economy is one of HSBC's long-term strategies and we are working closely with enterprises to build a sustainable future together. We have created a video series that includes interviews with leading corporations from across a range of sectors, including Climate Technology, Construction and Real Estate, Textile and Garment, and Shipping Logistics. Our videos provide insight on how these companies have been able to achieve success by partnering with a bank that shares a philosophy for sustainability.
