## Global Supply Chains â€“ Networks of Tomorrow

Trade remains the bedrock of the global economy, so corporates in Asia and around the world financial decision makers are constantly making supply chain decisions to ensure resilience and adaptability in their business operations.

For the last three years HSBC has examined how corporate treasurers and senior managers are reshaping their supply chain and working capital strategies in response to global economic changes, sustainability policies and digital enhancements.

This year, we've expanded the scope from just Asia Pacific to include globally strategic markets. We spoke to 787 corporations across 14 markets in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Here we look at Hong Kong, regional and global responses in context, discovering viewpoints on future supply chains, the needs of companies and their treasuries today, and how the right banking solutions can help.

> We are seeing increased demand from clients for simplified trade financing solutions to enable them to easily track and manage their supply chains. Through our comprehensive set of digital trade solutions, we aim to ensure they have all the tools to streamline their businesses with faster access to financing and better visibility and control over transactions.
