### Protect and finance your post shipment trade with forfaiting services that finance while managing risk.

## Our forfaiting solutions

### Export forfaiting

Obtain cash ahead of payment date by the importer while managing commercial and credit risk. Forfaiting makes your business more competitive as it allows you to offer longer credit terms to your buyers, without needing to wait for payment. Forfaiting works as an off-balance sheet financing solution that improves financial statements.

### Import forfaiting

Obtain credit terms for your purchases that an exporter may be unable to provide (receive your goods now, but pay for them later). Obtain financing that may work out at a lower cost than the borrowing costs available locally in your country.
