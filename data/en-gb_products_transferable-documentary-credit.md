## How it works

A Transferable Documentary Credit (DC) is a DC with the option to allow an intermediary agent to transfer their rights and obligations to the supplier. As a result the supplier is also required to meet your terms and conditions.

A Transferable DC is often used when:

* The intermediary agent is unable to supply some or all of the goods stipulated in the DC and therefore wishes to transfer part, or all, of the credit
* The intermediary agent is unable to secure back-to-back credit facilities from their bank and the supplier demands settlement by DC
* The intermediary agent acts as the sourcing agent and is responsible for distributing portions of the DC (usually a large amount) to various suppliers
