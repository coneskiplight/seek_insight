## Inaugural ESG Index in the GBA

As one of China's most open and economically vibrant areas, the GBA’s Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area includes sustainable development concepts such as green development and improving people’s livelihood. HSBC has released the first GBA ESG Index in Q4 2022 to effectively reflect the status and direction of sustainable development in the GBA.

Developed in partnership with China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP) Environmental Consulting Group Limited, a consultancy specialising in sustainable management as well as green and sustainable finance, the HSBC GBA ESG Index provides holistic insights into the area’s sustainable development.

The GBA ESG Index uses a combination of macro and micro methodologies and is updated quarterly. As well as the main GBA ESG Regional Index, a number of sub-indices are compiled, including City Sub-indices, Industry Sub-indices and Sub-indices by company size. The GBA ESG Index aims to objectively reflect and track the GBA’s sustainable development and its ESG.

From a macro perspective, we analyse the region, cities and industrial characteristics from five areas: policy, environment, economic and social development, corporate governance, and green and sustainable finance. The ESG performance of companies is evaluated from a micro perspective using the following five first-level indicators: environmental, social, governance, green and sustainable finance, and external assurance. To these an adjustment indicator, ESG reputation, is added which takes negative or controversial ESG events into consideration.

Hong Kong is also looking for opportunities to tap into the decarbonisation potential of hydrogen within the context of existing infrastructure. The report also discusses green and sustainable financing available for the hydrogen industrial chain. Certain activities within the supply chain have been recognised as potential green project types according to leading green and sustainable taxonomies. Differences in taxonomies can create increasing financing opportunities.
