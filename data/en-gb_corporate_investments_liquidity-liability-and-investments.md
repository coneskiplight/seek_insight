### Increase the efficiency of your operations by managing cash on a portfolio basis across more than 50 markets around the world.

With HSBC’s global liquidity solutions you will have access to a range of self-funding, deposit and investment techniques. HSBC’s liquidity solutions will be tailored and restricted to be fully compliant with local market regulations that may limit or restrict the availability of some of the services described below. HSBC’s approach combines a high level of consistent service and information, which enables us to configure our services to integrate easily with your organisation’s existing ERP and treasury management systems, as well as your key processes such as payable and receivables.

## Our liquidity, liability and investments solutions

### Cash concentration

Eliminate idle balances across all of your company’s accounts with the ability to physically transfer (“sweep”) excess funds into a single master account.

### Deposit account

Earn greater interest on excess cash by holding it in an account separate from your primary business account.

### Interest enhancement

Improve credit interest rates with preferential pricing based on total balances across all of your accounts, regardless of location or currency.

### Notional pooling

Pool balances across several participating accounts in a single currency or multiple currencies to earn interest on the net aggregate without actually commingling funds.
