## 'Exploring the GBA Start-up Ecosystem’ Research

HSBC has partnered with Hong Kong Trade Development Council to launch a report ‘Exploring the GBA Start-up Ecosystem’ to gauge startups’ view on prospects, opportunities and challenges of business expansion in the GBA; and examine the unique advantages of Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen with the start-ups in GBA, and explored collaboration opportunities among the GBA cities.

Over 80 of start-ups in the GBA were satisfied with the local start-up ecosystem, and optimistic about their business outlook. 71% of the start-ups expected business revenue to grow more than 25% within the next three years.

## “Retail's Realignment: The Road Ahead for Omnichannel in the GBA” Survey Report

A joint survey by HSBC, KPMG China and GS1 Hong Kong, titled *Retail's Realignment: The Road Ahead for Omnichannel in the Greater Bay Area*, surveyed 2,053 consumers and 400 senior retail industry executives in Hong Kong SAR and nine mainland GBA cities and examines the digitalisation and technology trends and related corporate strategies in the retail sector. It finds that as consumers embrace an increasingly online-to-offline (O2O)-driven retail ecosystem, companies need to focus on making the online experience user-friendly, engaging and easy to transact on.

> In order to deliver a seamless customer journey, more retailers in the GBA are looking for a single platform that can take payments from multiple channels – from credit cards, bank transfers to e-wallets. At HSBC, we observed exponential growth in the transactional volume of our Omni Collect payment solution in Asia since it went live in 2018. In Hong Kong and mainland China alone, the volume has increased 125% year on year in April 2021, while the transactional value has grown 165%.
