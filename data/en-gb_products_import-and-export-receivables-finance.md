## Features and benefits

###

* Another way to get finance when a buyer no longer issues Documentary Credits (DCs)
* People to follow up payments on your behalf

## How it works

* You sign an agreement with HSBC
* You provide goods or services to a customer and invoice them
* You send the invoice to us
* You have access to standby funds up to an agreed percentage of the invoice value
* When and how you use these funds is entirely up to you
* Either HSBC or an overseas representative under our supervision will collect the sales proceeds from your customer
* When the invoice is paid, you receive the balance
* In the case of undisputed receivables where a customer defaults or becomes insolvent, if you have taken out credit protection on the customer with us, we will pay you the outstanding balance up to the value of the agreed credit protection limit
