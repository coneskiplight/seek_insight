a. A citizen\* or resident of the United States,

b. A partnership created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State, or the District of Columbia,

c. A corporation created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State, or the District of Columbia,

Please seek your own independent professional advice to confirm your U.S. / Non-U.S. status.

2. What is W form?

The W-8 form is a requirement of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for U.S. tax reporting for
non-U.S. persons. Non-U.S. persons are subject to U.S. withholding on certain types of income received from
U.S. sources, such as interest and dividends.

Non-U.S. persons are required to complete and submit a duly completed W-8 Form for the following main
reasons:

* to establish that you are not a U.S. person; and
* to claim that you are the beneficiary of the US-sourced income for which the W form is provided; and
* to claim, if applicable, a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding tax by being a resident of a
  foreign country/region with which the United States has an income tax treaty.

If you would like to know more about the instructions for W form and tax treaties, please visit HSBC FATCA
page, U.S. IRS website or consult your tax adviser.

* [Instructions for W form](https://www.irs.gov/forms-instructions-and-publications)
* [Tax Treaties Information](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z)

3. Will W-8 form expire?

In general, W-8 form is valid for a period of 3 years provided that there is no change to your information or
Non-U.S. person status. For details, please visit U.S. IRS website or consult your tax adviser.

4. What should I do if my W-8 form is expired or my Non-U.S. status is changed?

Duly complete a new W form and submit it via Business Internet Banking.

5. What is the NYSE Market Data Agreement?

The NYSE Market Data relates to provision of market data by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As required
by NYSE, every HSBC customer must sign this agreement to confirm that he/she is a market data subscriber
before obtaining access to the NYSE's market data.

6. Will my U.S. securities instructions be executed in alternative trading venues?

In respect of orders for securities listed on stock exchanges outside of Hong Kong, it is our existing
practices that the Bank may transmit your orders to affiliated HSBC entities and third party brokers for
execution, who may, subject to local regulation, execute such orders on alternative trading venues ("ATVs"),
including dark pools.

The primary potential benefits for using ATVs is to achieve better pricing and to reduce transaction costs.
In general, ATVs and ATV operators are subject to regulations which are not necessarily the same as
regulations that are applicable to exchanges and exchange operators. A typical feature of ATVs is that there
is no pre-trade transparency. The reference prices on an ATV could be "stale" or out-of-date due to latency
from data feeds. Separately, access to ATVs is usually restricted and there could be less supply and/or
demand on an ATV (as compared to the supply and/or demand on an exchange) due to the limited number of
participants.

Our affiliated HSBC entities and third party brokers generally consider the execution price and opportunities
for price improvement when deciding the appropriate venue for executing orders. There may also be other
factors in their consideration, for example (i) market depth and order size; (ii) the trading
characteristics of the security; (iii) speed and accuracy of executions; (iv) the availability of efficient
and reliable order handling systems; (v) liquidity and automatic execution guarantees; (vi) service levels;
(vii) the cost of executing orders; and (viii) execution certainty. The Bank will continue to monitor and
evaluate the execution practices of our affiliated HSBC entities and third party brokers.

7. Can I choose to opt out alternative trading venues ("ATVs") for executing my U.S. securities instructions?

Customers cannot choose to opt out ATVs but please rest assure that execution in ATVs would have been
reviewed and have adopted the applicable local regulatory requirements. The Bank will continue to monitor
and evaluate the execution practices of our affiliated HSBC entities and third-party brokers.
