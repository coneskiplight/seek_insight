Please note that the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEx”) will implement Severe Weather Trading from 23 September 2024, which allows Hong Kong securities and derivatives markets to remain open during trading days with severe weather conditions, such as when Typhoon Signal No.8 or above and/or a Black Rainstorm Warning is issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, or if an “Extreme Conditions” announcement is made by the HKSAR Government. More details about Severe Weather Trading (“SWT”) can be found from the website of HKEx.

For cheque processing and clearing under SWT, the following arrangement will be made:

All other paper cheques deposited will be processed on the next business day (if not affected by severe weather conditions)
2. If severe weather conditions are in effect after 9am or cancelled before/at 12noon on a business day, paper cheques will be processed and cleared as usual (please note that the cut-off time of Cheque Deposit Machines may be changed under severe weather conditions, please refer to the notice posted near the machine for details)
