## Product highlights

You may be thinking, "What's the big deal? My office doesn't consume much paper". But what most people do not realize is that the cost of buying paper is just the top of the paper iceberg. For each sheet of paper used, the social cost incurs not only purchasing costs, but also storage, printing, postage, disposal, and recycling – and it adds up.

HSBC would like to team up with your company to help reduce the amount of paper your office consumes by using eStatement and eAdvice service and going paperless.
