## Notes

1. Investment involves risks. The information in this document does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation for the purchase or sale of any deposit or investment in any investment products referred to herein. The price of investments may move up or down. There is an inherent risk that losses may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling investment products.

   * You should carefully consider whether any investment products or services mentioned herein are appropriate for you in view of your investment experience, objectives, financial resources and circumstances.
   * Unit Trusts are NOT equivalent to time deposits.
   * Unit Trusts are investment products and some of them are structured products involving derivatives. The investment decision is yours but you should not invest in the Unit Trusts unless the intermediary who sells it to you has explained to you that the product is suitable for you having regard to your financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives.
   * Investment involves risks. Past performance of investment products are no guide to future performance. The value of investments and the income from them can fluctuate and is not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount they invest.
   * Investment returns not denominated in home currency are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down.
   * Issuer's Risk -– you rely on issuer's creditworthiness. Investment products are subject to both the actual and perceived measures of credit worthiness of the issuer. There is no assurance of protection against a default by the issuer in respect of the repayment obligations. In the worst case scenario (e.g. insolvency of issuer), the investor might not be able to recover the principal and/or any interest/coupon (if any) and the potential maximum loss could be 100% of investment amount and no interest/coupon received.
