## The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area

Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (The Greater Bay Area) is an initiative that will form an exciting new chapter in South China’s history. The Greater Bay Area aims to bring together the two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao with nine cities in Guangdong: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, Dongguan, Huizhou, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing. Together, they will form a world-class city cluster that will play a leading role in global innovation, finance and trade.

By combining the strengths of each city to facilitate trade and growth, the Greater Bay Area has the potential to be an economic powerhouse that will be comparable or even surpass leading bay areas across the globe, such as the Greater Tokyo Bay, San Francisco Bay Area, and New York Metropolitan Area.
