## Features and benefits

* Protects your interests if your buyer does not issue Documentary Credits
* Puts you in a position to negotiate better terms and prices
* Simple and cost effective
* Documents and payment collections are handled on your behalf
* Reduces disputes as Documentary Collections are governed by URC522\*, which clearly defines the responsibilities of different parties, along with interest and expense issues
* Access to HSBC's international network makes it easier to chase outstanding payments

## Potential risks

* Since payment is not made until after the goods are shipped, you bear the risk while goods are in transit or storage until payment or acceptance takes place
* The banks involved in the transaction do not guarantee payment

Always check a buyer's credit status and reputation before agreeing to a Documentary Collection.
