## Disclaimer

The price of bonds can and does fluctuate, and any individual bonds may experience upward or downward movements, and may even become valueless. Factors affecting market price of Bonds include, and are not limited to, fluctuations in Interest Rates, Credit Spreads, and Liquidity Premiums. The fluctuation in yield generally has a greater effect on prices of longer tenor Bonds. There is an inherent risk that losses may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling bonds.

**Important Note**

The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells it to you has advised you that it is suitable for you and has explained why, including how buying it would be consistent with your investment objectives. If you are unsure of the suitability of the product, you should not subscribe to it.

You should carefully consider whether any investment products or services mentioned herein are appropriate for you in view of your investment experience, objectives, financial resources and circumstances.

Bond is NOT equivalent to a time deposit.

Investment involves risks. Past performance of investment products are no guide to future performance. The value of investments and the income from them can fluctuate and is not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount they invest.

Investment returns not denominated in home currency are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down.

Issuer's Risk -– you rely on issuer's creditworthiness. The product is subject to both the actual and perceived measures of credit worthiness of the issuer. There is no assurance of protection against a default by the issuer in respect of the repayment obligations. In the worst case scenario (e.g. insolvency of issuer), the investor might not be able to recover the principal and/or any interest /coupon (if any) and the potential maximum loss could be 100% of investment amount and no interest/coupon received.

If you wish to sell Bonds, HSBC may repurchase it based on the prevailing market price under normal market circumstances, but the selling price may differ from the original buying price due to changes in market conditions.

The secondary market for Bonds may not provide significant liquidity or may trade at prices based on the prevailing market conditions and may not be in line with the expectations of Bonds holders.

If a Bond is early redeemed, you may not be able to enjoy the same rates of return when you re-invest the funds in other investments.

Please refer to the offering documents of the respective Bond products for details, including risk factors.
