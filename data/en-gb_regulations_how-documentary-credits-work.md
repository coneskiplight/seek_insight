# How Documentary Credits Work

## In basic terms, a Documentary Credit (DC) is an undertaking by a bank to make payment, provided the terms of the DC are met. There are several types of DC – the main difference is that some are more suited to transactions involving middlemen or traders.

## Revocable or irrevocable?

DCs can be irrevocable or revocable. With a revocable DC, the buyer can change or cancel it after issuance. You should always insist on an irrevocable DC so that it can’t be cancelled without your consent.

## Trade Finance

An export DC makes it easier to obtain pre-shipment finance in the form of a packing credit, or post-shipment finance where the documents under the DC are negotiated.
