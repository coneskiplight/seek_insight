## What can I do with the Request & Form Tracker?

Here are some examples of how you can use the Request & Form Tracker in Business Internet Banking:

Scenario 1: Tracking your business information update online as a Primary User

You've submitted a Business Information Update in Business Internet Banking, and you want to check on the progress of the request. You visit the Request & Form Tracker, and see it prompts you that we're waiting for an eSignature from your new authorised signatory(1).

You then click to expand the accordion on the left(2) to check what stage your request has reached. The tracker shows that the application was submitted on 1 January, but it cannot progress to the next step until your company's new authorised signatory provides their eSignature, which they need to do by 8 January(3). Because you're a Primary User, you can click the 'View status details' button(4) at the bottom right to get more details about the request.

On the 'View status details' page you can access further information, including the latest updates on pending actions and who needs to take them. Once the request is complete, you can view the full record here and download a summary for your records.

Scenario 2: Keeping track of a change of address form submitted offline as a Secondary User

You've submitted a paper form to request a change of address. You can use the Request & Form Tracker to check the progress of the application, including the date we received it, when we're processing it, and when it's complete.
