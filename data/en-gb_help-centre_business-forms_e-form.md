# e-Form

## How it works

We are introducing a simpler, faster and easier way for you to submit eligible banking forms through Business Internet Banking (BIB) 24x7 without postage, no matter you are currently station at HK or overseas.

You can simply either:   
(i) choose the forms under ‘e-Form’ section below then click ‘Logon & submit form’; Or,  
(ii) logon to BIB > Go to ‘My HSBC’ > ‘Admin Tools’ > ‘Overview’> ’e-Form Submission Centre’ under ‘Service application portal’> select the form then follow the instructions on the screen to proceed.

More forms will be available as e-Forms from time to time. Please stay tuned.

Both Primary User and Secondary User can perform e-Form submission. Any employee of your company can be a Secondary User. Secondary Users are responsible for the day-to-day running of the company accounts under BIB.  
Click [here](https://www.online-banking.business.hsbc.com.hk/portalserver/hsbc/content/commercial/online/gbb/userguide/BIB_SU_Creation_user_guide_EN.pdf) to learn how to create Secondary User.

\* Some submissions may require to be “printed, signed and uploaded” instead of completing online directly due to (i) its form nature, or (ii) your company’s structure. We will help the triage upon your form selection on BIB.

^ No approval is required if the requester is the only Primary User (PU) of the company profile, also the sole proprietor / sole director of the company. BIB user can always check the approval / submission status: Log on BIB > ‘Service & Support' > ‘Request & Form Tracker’
