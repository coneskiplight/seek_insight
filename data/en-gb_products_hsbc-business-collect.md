### ‘FPS x PromptPay QR payment’

With the sharp development of Faster Payment System (FPS) and the strong demand for cross-border real time payments, there is an epochal improvement of FPS.

With the introduction of the ‘FPS x PromptPay QR payment’ service, there is a bilateral linkage between Hong Kong’s FPS and Thailand’s mobile payment system, PromptPay. HSBC Business Collect has been seamlessly integrated with the ‘FPS x PromptPay QR payment’ service. You as a merchant can receive real-time payments in Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) from Thai visitors who scan the FPS QR codes and make payments via PromptPay. You can also enjoy a cost-effective solution that supports mobile payment collection to enhance customer experience in retail payment, thereby driving business growth.
