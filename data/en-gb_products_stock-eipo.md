## eIPO Frequently Asked Questions

What is an IPO?

IPO stands for Initial Public Offering. It is the first time a company issues securities/bonds to investors. The newly issued securities/bonds may be listed on a stock exchange.

What are the risks associated with IPOs?

**Over-subscribing to an IPO**

In some cases, IPOs may be oversubscribed. The company may go through a balloting/allocation process to determine whether an investor will receive any securities and if so, in what quantity. An investor may be tempted to subscribe for a greater quantity than he intended to, believing that he will not receive the full amount in case of over-subscription. However if the IPO is not oversubscribed, the investor will receive all the quantity applied for and will have to pay the full cost.

**Market risk**

There is a risk that the company's share price will drop below its initial IPO price, once the company's securities/bonds trading (on the stock market or otherwise) commences. Securities/bond/ prices will fluctuate over time.

**Company risk**

It is vital to understand the company and the business you are investing in. Thoroughly study the prospectus, financial reports and even seek professional advice before you make investment decisions. For more information on investing, visit our Investment Services.
