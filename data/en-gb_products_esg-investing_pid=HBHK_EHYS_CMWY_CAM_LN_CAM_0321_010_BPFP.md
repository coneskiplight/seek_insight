## What is sustainable or ESG Investing?

In recent years, investors in the financial industry have introduced a new concept: Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) – supplementing traditional financial concepts.

* Environmental (E) - How companies reduce environmental impacts of waste, water use and pollution
* Social (S) - How companies build community engagement with their labour practices – and more
* Governance (G) - How companies are governed, e.g. appropriate regulatory tools in place, diversity of their board, etc.

## Why does it matter?

ESG changes are rapidly reshaping how people live and invest. ESG factors have entered the mainstream and have the potential to drive investment outperformance.

The price of units or shares and the income from them may go down as well as up and any past performance figures shown are not indicative of future performance. You should carefully consider whether any investment products or services mentioned herein are appropriate for you in view of your risk appetite, investment experience, objectives, financial resources, and circumstances. The information contained on this website is intended for Hong Kong residents only and should not be construed as a distribution, an offer to sell, or a solicitation to buy any securities in any jurisdiction where such activities would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction, in particular the United States of America.

**Important Note**

You should carefully consider whether any investment products or services mentioned herein are appropriate for you in view of your investment experience, objectives, financial resources, and circumstances.

Unit Trusts are NOT equivalent to time deposits.

Unit Trusts are investment products and some of them are structured products involving derivatives. The investment decision is yours, but you should not invest in the Unit Trusts unless the intermediary who sells it to you has explained to you that the product is suitable for you having regard to your financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives.

Investment involves risks. Past performance of investment products are no guide to future performance. The value of investments and the income from them can fluctuate and is not guaranteed. Investors may not get back the amount they invest.

Investment returns not denominated in home currency are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down.

Issuer's Risk -– you rely on issuer's creditworthiness. Investment products are subject to both the actual and perceived measures of credit worthiness of the issuer. There is no assurance of protection against a default by the issuer in respect of the repayment obligations. In the worst-case scenario (e.g. insolvency of issuer), the investor might not be able to recover the principal and/or any interest/coupon (if any) and the potential maximum loss could be 100% of investment amount and no interest/coupon received.

\* **Terms and Conditions:**

1. The offer cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotional or preferential offer.
2. The offer cannot be used in conjunction with other promotional offers on the initial charge. All other fees and charges applicable to the relevant fund (including switching fees, redemption fees, management fees and other fees) still apply.
3. The Bank reserves the right to amend the promotional offers and these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.
4. In case of disputes arising out of this promotion, the decision of the Bank shall be final.
5. In case of discrepancies between the English and Chinese versions, the English version shall prevail.
