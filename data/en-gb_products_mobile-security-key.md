## Frequently asked questions

How can I access multiple company profiles with one username and Mobile Security Key?

When you have multiple company profiles and Business Internet Banking (BIB) usernames, you can choose to access multiple profiles with one username. You'll need to activate Mobile Security Key for your chosen username. To learn how to activate Mobile Security Key, please see our Mobile Security Key [user guide](https://www.online-banking.business.hsbc.com.hk/portalserver/hsbc/content/commercial/online/gbb/userguide/How_to_activate_MSK_en.pdf).

After you've activated Mobile Security Key for your chosen username, you can add company profiles to that username so to access multiple profiles at the same time. To learn how to add profiles, please see our [user guide](https://www.online-banking.business.hsbc.com.hk/portalserver/hsbc/content/commercial/online/gbb/userguide/BIB_post_Add_Profile_EN.pdf) on adding profiles.

You'll be able to access all profiles added to your chosen username after 8 a.m. on the next day by logging on to BIB with Mobile Security Key. Once you have added a company profile to your chosen username, you will no longer be able to access it with its original username.

I have previously enabled biometric authentication in the HSBC HK Business Express mobile app. Can I continue to log on using fingerprint or facial recognition?

Yes, biometric authentication is now tied in with the Mobile Security Key. Simply confirm your Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint ID after activating Mobile Security Key.
