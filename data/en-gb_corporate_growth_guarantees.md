# Guarantees

### Conduct business with confidence, even where you lack established relationships, through the use of guarantees and standby letters of credit.

An HSBC guarantee could enable you to negotiate favourable terms with buyers and suppliers by protecting them from non-performance under a contract while addressing your financing needs. HSBC offers tailored solutions including performance, advance payment, tender, warranty, financial guarantees and standby letters of credit as well as others upon request.

## Our guarantees solutions

### Financial guarantees

Use our lease, customs and other financial guarantees as a substitute for cash deposits with your counterparties, freeing your working capital and potentially securing favourable contract terms.

### Non-financial guarantees

Open up new tender opportunities with HSBC-issued tender bonds, negotiate better contract terms via our performance and warranty guarantees and secure up-front payments via our advance payment guarantees.

### Standby letters of credit

In markets where your suppliers and buyers are less comfortable with guarantees, HSBC can support your business via both financial and non-financial standby letters of credit.
