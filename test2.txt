025 Work Year End Summary

Introduction

2025 has been a year full of challenges and breakthroughs for me. I proactively pushed my limits by exploring new fields and enhancing core skills, with focused efforts on AI technology exploration, presentation ability improvement, and effective communication across diverse teams and with senior stakeholders. This year’s experiences have significantly boosted my professional capabilities and contributed to team goals.

Key Achievements in AI Field

This year, I dedicated substantial energy to exploring AI applications in the banking sector, completing multiple AI use cases while researching various technical tools and frameworks.

Technical Exploration and Collaboration

• Explored diverse LLM providers (both online and offline) and cutting-edge GenAI development frameworks, including Llama Index, AutoGen, and LangChain.

• Researched emerging technologies such as OpenAI Research to identify their practical application scenarios in banking.

• Collaborated internally with the GDD team to support on-prem platform development, and evaluated suitable tools for building AI use cases.

Core AI Use Cases

1. "See Inside" Use Case: Built on the Llama Index framework, leveraging Text-to-SQL training and DC models to enhance data accessibility and analysis efficiency.

2. KYC Report Generation: Utilized technologies from OpenAI Research to automate and optimize the KYC report creation process, improving accuracy and speed.

3. Omni-Channel Campaign Content Generation: Applied RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) handoff to generate targeted content for cross-channel marketing campaigns, boosting user engagement.

4. Time Deposit Pricing Quotation Acceleration: Developed an AI-driven solution to streamline the pricing quotation process, reducing turnaround time and enhancing operational efficiency.

5. ODI Opportunity Identification: Designed a multi-agent system framework to identify and evaluate Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) opportunities, providing data-driven insights for decision-making.

Advanced Analytics: Cash Flow Analysis Project

Beyond AI, I focused on advanced analytics in cash flow management, aiming to identify potential customers for lending and investment products and detect early-stage business opportunities.

Data and Tools

• Data Sources: Utilized industry data (MV3 salmon), traditional internal data (including deposit balances, internal and external information), and counterparty data.

• Analytics Tools:

◦ Cash Flow Catalyzation: Segmented companies based on short-term cash flow behaviors for targeted analysis.

◦ Spectral Analysis: Measured cash flow stability to assess corporate risk levels.

◦ Neural Analysis: Evaluated customer influence to support presentation and client development efforts.

◦ Cash Flow Future Prediction: Forecasted net cash flow trends for the next 6 months, identifying potential funding gaps or unexpected fluctuations.

Additional Responsibilities

I also took charge of ET (Event Trigger) Management, which was implemented as an SBAT (Small Batch Agile Test) initiative, contributing to the team’s process optimization and risk response capabilities.

Conclusion and Future Outlook

2025 has been a rewarding year of growth, where I translated technical exploration into practical results in AI and advanced analytics. Looking ahead, I will continue to deepen my expertise in AI and data analysis, explore more innovative applications in the banking industry, and contribute more effectively to the team’s strategic objectives.
