Advanced Analytics: Cash Flow Analysis Project

Beyond AI, I focused on advanced analytics in cash flow management, with core objectives to identify potential customers for lending and investment products and detect early-stage business opportunities. To achieve these goals, I integrated multiple analytic tools and sub-projects, leveraging their collaborative strengths to form a systematic analysis framework.

Data and Tools

• Data Sources: Utilized industry data (MV3 salmon), traditional internal data (including deposit balances, internal and external information), and counterparty data to ensure comprehensive and accurate analysis.

• Integrated Analytics Workflow:

1. Cash Flow Catalyzation: First, I used this tool to segment companies based on short-term cash flow behaviors, enabling the identification of enterprises with distinct growth momentum.

2. Spectral Analysis: For the emerging companies screened in the previous step, this tool was applied to measure their cash flow stability, verifying whether their growth momentum was supported by reliable financial fundamentals.

3. Neural Analysis: This tool helped validate the role and influence of target companies within their respective ecosystems, providing insights into their market positioning and cooperation potential.

4. Cash Flow Future Prediction: After completing the above analyses and prototype verification, I used this tool to forecast net cash flow trends for the next 6 months. This step confirmed the future operational prospects of target companies, allowing us to prioritize key targets and formulate the final "Orange Strategy".
